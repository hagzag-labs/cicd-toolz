# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
